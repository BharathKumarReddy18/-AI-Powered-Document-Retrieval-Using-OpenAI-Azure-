ðŸš€ AI-Powered Document Retrieval Using OpenAI & Azure

This project leverages GPT-3.5 Turbo 16K, Azure Vector Search, and SharePoint to build an intelligent document retrieval system. It enables users to search for documents based on semantic similarity, ensuring more accurate and relevant results compared to traditional keyword-based search.

Features
âœ… AI-driven semantic search for document retrieval
âœ… GPT-3.5 Turbo 16K for generating high-quality embeddings
âœ… Azure Vector Search for similarity-based retrieval
âœ… SharePoint integration for document storage
âœ… Web interface for seamless user experience

Tech Stack
OpenAI GPT-3.5 Turbo 16K â€“ Generates embeddings for similarity search
Azure Vector Search â€“ Enables efficient document retrieval
SharePoint â€“ Used as document storage
Azure Functions (Python) â€“ Backend for processing search queries
HTML, CSS, JavaScript â€“ Frontend for user interaction
Postman â€“ Used to configure data sources, indexes, and skillsets
How It Works
Document Upload â€“ Files are stored in SharePoint
Embedding Generation â€“ GPT-3.5 Turbo 16K creates vector embeddings
Indexing & Storage â€“ Embeddings are stored in Azure Vector Search
User Query â€“ The user searches for a document via the web interface
Semantic Search â€“ The system finds and retrieves the most relevant document based on similarity
Challenges & Learnings
Optimizing embedding-based search for higher accuracy
Fine-tuning Azure Vector Search for faster response times
Enhancing user experience with an intuitive web interface
